    "Good morning, Panadek. I know you hate being up this early, but you're one day closer to me.",
    "I know things are tough right now, but I believe in you. Go show them what my amazing boyfriend can do.",
    "Wakey wakey! I literally cannot wait to see your stupid face. I miss it more than you know.",
    "Try to focus today... even though I know you're just thinking about when you'll see me next.",
    "Sending you a virtual morning hug. Warning: The real one is going to last at least an hour.",
    "Rise and shine, Panadek! It's time to start your day thinking about me.",
    "I hope your coffee is strong, but my love for you is definitely stronger. Have a good day, handsome.",
    "Just a reminder as you start your day: You are capable, you are loved, and you are going to see me very soon.",
    "Your opening move for the day: Get out of bed. You got this, grandmaster.",

    "You worked so hard today. I'm proud of you. Now put the phone down and rest, Panadek.",
    "Sleep well, instructor. Better rest up, you have a lot of 'teaching' to do when I see you.",
    "I never thought I'd be this clingy with anyone, but I hate sleeping without you.",
    "Missing your hugs and your touch tonight. Dream of me.",
    "No matter how hard today was, remember I love you and I've got your back. Always.",
    "Stop scrolling and close your eyes. I'll meet you in your dreams.",
    "My bed feels way too empty without you. Counting down the seconds until that changes.",
    "Goodnight to my favorite human. Don't let the hard days win. You're doing great.",
    "Saving up all my cuddles for when I see you. You better be ready.",
    "Rest your brilliant mind, my love. Checkmate the day, now time to sleep.",
